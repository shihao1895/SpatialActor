## 🌟 News

- 🔥 [2025-11-8] Our paper [SpatialActor]() was accepted as an AAAI 2026 **Oral**!

## Overview

SpatialActor is a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation. It decouples perception into complementary high-level geometry from fine-grained but noisy raw depth and coarse but robust depth expert priors, along with low-level spatial cues and appearance semantics.
